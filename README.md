  [Day 3](https://xccelerate.talentlms.com/unit/view/id:2573)

### How it works :open_book:

- [ ] Clone this repository, open the files and fill them out according to the directions

- Opening index.html:
  - Right click on index.html
  - Hover over "Open with..."
  - Select your code editor (to change code) OR chrome (to see it)
  - Whenever you change your code, make sure to refresh the chrome page

## Exercises Due :athletic_shoe:

- [ ] Exercise A: Create a bootstrap page with a navigation bar, list group and buttons

- [ ] Exercise B: Flowershop VIII

  - [ ] The four logos at the bottom should collapse to one vertical line on mobile site. (You can use the Chrome Toggle Device Toolbar feature to test for the mobile responsiveness of your website.)

  - [ ] The four logos should remain in two columns on a medium screen.

- [ ] Exercise C: Loop

- [ ] Exercise D: Multiply Number

- [ ] Exercise F: Fizzbuzz

- [ ] Finish the 'What is one thing that I learned from doing this project?' in the readme

### Tips :tipping_hand_woman:

- We highly encourage you to follow practice the exercises; reading about code is not always enough, sometimes it's also important to practice implementing the specific steps. Don't worry if it feels difficult - that's normal. The important thing is to keep going, even when it feels hard :relaxed:

- If you get stuck, try to break down the problem. What small thing can you figure out first? Remember, instructors have a no touching your key board rule (we can help guide you, but won't debug for you!). Part of being a software engineer IS solving problems. It's a marathon, not a sprint :running_woman:

- Other debugging tips
  - [ ] Write down the logic of your code
  - [ ] Re-read documentation
  - [ ] Look at example code on github
  - [ ] Go slow. Do one thing at a time. You got this :muscle:
